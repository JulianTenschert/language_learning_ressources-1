## Passive Understanding

To get an passive understanding of a language and get a natural grip of the use of a language it's best to surround yourself with it. Good methods are for example:

* Watching childrens cartoons in the language while working
* Listening to music in the language
* Going on holidays in the country where the language is spoken (unfortunately not pandemic-friendly)
* listening to podcasts in the language
* watching youtube videos about topics you're interested and also familiar with


## Working with Books

After you watched and listened to a lot of ressources in your target language, you can now work with books. You have a feeling about how that languages sounds and now you can start to actually learn different things. I recommend using a sentence based approach.

* Assimil if it is available in your target language
* children books are great to start because they use easy language (preferably those with audio)
* language books with good audio quality

## Working with Audio

If you want to learn new language skills, try Audible! It's a really fun way of learning new skills in whatever new language you'd like to learn. It's really great! (Thanks Jeff!)
