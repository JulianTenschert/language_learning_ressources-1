# Language Learning Ressources

You want to learn a language but you're not sure where to start? Here you can find methods that worked for me in my language learning journey.

You have good ressources or tips for learning a language? Then why not tell everybody and contribute to this repository. 

## Passive Understanding

To get an passive understanding of a language and get a natural grip of the use of a language it's best to surround yourself with it. Good methods are for example:

* Watching childrens cartoons in the language while working
* Listening to music in the language
* Going on holidays in the country where the language is spoken (unfortunately not pandemic-friendly)
* listening to podcasts in the language
* watching youtube videos about topics you're interested and also familiar with


## Working with Books

After you watched and listened to a lot of ressources in your target language, you can now work with books. You have a feeling about how that languages sounds and now you can start to actually learn different things. I recommend using a sentence based approach.

* Assimil if it is available in your target language
* children books are great to start because they use simple language (preferably those with audio)
* language books with good audio quality

## Working with Audio

If you want to learn new language skills, try Audible! It's a really fun way of learning new skills in whatever new language you'd like to learn. It's really great! (Thanks Jeff!)


## Learning A Language With Another Writing System

There are languages that only have a couple of other letters (e. g. ö, ł, œ, ę), those that have other forms or uses of letters (e. g. Bulgarian, Russian, Greek, Hiragana in the Japanese writing system, Arabic) and there are those with no letters (e. g. Chinese, Kanji). It can take a little longer to get used to using those but if you want to have a deep understanding, it's pretty much a must to learn those.

* some like Hiragana are pretty easy to learn: practice the letters and make sure you repeat the learning
* Make sure to write - a lot. Even though we can communicate with smartphones and they make it pretty easy: Make sure to write. It helps also with remembering the letters/characters
* Also here: Use childrens books to get used to the writing system.


## Writing Skills

Writing is not important for everyone when you can easily write with your smartphone that is pretty smart when it comes to writing in your target language. You don't have to be able to write the words with a pencil and with some smartphones you don't have to know exactly how to write your e. g. Chinese character – you only have to know the pronounciation and be able to recognise the right character. But I strongly encourage everyone to also be able to write in your target language. It helps a lot.

* write at least a little everyday in your target language – with a pen and not with your thumbs on a phone
* You learned a difficult world today? Write it down.
* Also go back to the basics you already learned.


## Language Apps

Language apps can definitely help but keep in mind that writing and listening is very important, too. So most of the time apps are not enough. The good thing is: You can take them pretty much everywhere you go and some don't even need an internet connection.

* have one or more language apps on your phone for commuting or when you have to wait unexpectedly
* Try to write down new words on a small piece of paper it possible. It helps a lot with not forgetting new words.
* Apps will only get you so far. 


## Language Websites

There are a lot of websites for learning a language. You can just google the language and often times you find some good ones. I can recommend those where you can find language exchange partners or those that teach you basics.

* Try to find a website that has good beginner-friendly basics of your taget language. Those with audio are better most of the time – especially as a beginner.
* iTalki is a good website to let others check your writing and to find a language partner.
