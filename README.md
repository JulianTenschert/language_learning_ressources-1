## Passive Understanding

To get an passive understanding of a language and get a natural grip of the use of a language it's best to surround yourself with it. Good methods are for example:

* Watching childrens cartoons in the language while working
* Listening to music in the language
* Going on holidays in the country where the language is spoken (unfortunately not pandemic-friendly)
* listening to podcasts in the language
* watching youtube videos about topics you're interested and also familiar with


## Working with Books

After you watched and listened to a lot of ressources in your target language, you can now work with books. You have a feeling about how that languages sounds and now you can start to actually learn different things. I recommend using a sentence based approach.

* Assimil if it is available in your target language
* children books are great to start because they use simple language (preferably those with audio)
* language books with good audio quality

## Working with Audio

If you want to learn new language skills, try Audible! It's a really fun way of learning new skills in whatever new language you'd like to learn. It's really great! (Thanks Jeff!)


## Learning A Language With Another Writing System

There are languages that only have a couple of other letters (e. g. ö, ł, œ, ę), those that have other forms or uses of letters (e. g. Bulgarian, Russian, Greek, Hiragana in the Japanese writing system, Arabic) and there are those with no letters (e. g. Chinese, Kanji). It can take a little longer to get used to using those but if you want to have a deep understanding, it's pretty much a must to learn those.

* some like Hiragana are pretty easy to learn: practice the letters and make sure you repeat the learning
* Make sure to write - a lot. Even though we can communicate with smartphones and they make it pretty easy: Make sure to write. It helps also with remembering the letters/characters
* Also here: Use childrens books to get used to the writing system.
